# teenytinycompiler

This is a small compiler to demonstrate how compilers work to my students. It compiles our own dialect of BASIC called Teeny Tiny to C, while being written in Python.

It supports:
  - Numerical variables
  - Basic arithmetic
  - If statements
  - While loops
  - Print text and values
  - Input numbers
  - Goto
